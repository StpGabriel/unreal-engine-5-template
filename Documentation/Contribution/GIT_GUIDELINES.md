- Feature means everything that is content or code change (bugfix, new functionality, etc).
- Should contain the related issue number in the name. (Creating branch from GitHub website from the issue, uses this naming convention.)
- Can be created from `master` branch.
- Can be merged (by pull request) to `develop` or `feature/...` branch.
- SHOULD NOT BE DELETED after merge.
- SHOULD BE DELETED after it has become part of a release branch and release was merged (by pull request) to `master`.

### 1.2 Develop
